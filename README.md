# Windows-Sysinternals (Unofficial)
Windows based software diagnostc + forensic software.
 
## Motivation
Based on [Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/). This is my own open source attempt of creating windows based software diagnostics + forensic tools. I find this as an overall motivating project for me personally: I'm trying to learn windows internals, Trying to improve my C# skills, and just in general this is all a learning experience ill look back at one.
